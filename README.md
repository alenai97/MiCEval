# MiCEval: Unveiling Multimodal Chain of Thought's Quality via Image Description and Reasoning
The MiCEval dataset is stored in `dataset/MiCEval_hard.jsonl` and `dataset/MiCEval_Normal.jsonl`.

The images of the MiCEval dataset are stored in the `dataset/image` folder.

To reproduce the results of the verifier experiment, please run `scripts/verifier_zeroshot.sh` and `scripts/verifier_fewshot.sh`.

The code for the evaluator experiment will be updated soon.
